# EXPERIMENT - 12 - CONSTRUCTORS AND DESTRUCTORS IN C++

## Aim: To study and implement Constructors and Destructors in C++

## Apparatus: VS Code or Online C++ Compiler

## Theory:

**Constructors and Destructors** are special member functions in C++ that provide automatic initialization and cleanup of objects. They are fundamental components of Object-Oriented Programming that ensure proper object lifecycle management, memory allocation, and resource handling.

### Constructors:

A **Constructor** is a special member function that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It has the same name as the class and has no return type (not even void). Constructors are primarily used to initialize the data members of objects and allocate resources.

#### Key Characteristics of Constructors:
- **Same name as the class**
- **No return type** (not even void)
- **Automatically invoked** when an object is created
- **Can be overloaded** (multiple constructors with different parameters)
- **Cannot be virtual**
- **Cannot be inherited** (but can be called from derived class constructors)

#### Types of Constructors:

### 1. Default Constructor
A constructor that takes no parameters or has all parameters with default values.

**Characteristics:**
- Called when an object is created without any arguments
- If no constructor is defined, C++ provides an implicit default constructor
- Can be explicitly defined to perform custom initialization
- Useful for setting default values to data members

**Syntax:**
```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    ClassName() {           // Default Constructor
        // Initialization code
    }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic initialization of objects
- Ensures objects are in a valid state upon creation
- Allows object creation without providing initial values
- Prevents garbage values in data members

### 2. Parameterized Constructor
A constructor that accepts one or more parameters to initialize objects with specific values.

**Characteristics:**
- Accepts parameters to initialize data members with specific values
- Allows customized object initialization during creation
- Can have multiple parameterized constructors (constructor overloading)
- More flexible than default constructors

**Syntax:**
```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    ClassName(dataType param1, dataType param2) {    // Parameterized Constructor
        // Initialize data members with parameters
    }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Direct initialization with desired values
- Eliminates need for separate setter functions
- Ensures object is created with meaningful data
- Reduces code redundancy

### 3. Copy Constructor
A constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object of the same class.

**Characteristics:**
- Takes a reference to an object of the same class as parameter
- Creates a new object with the same values as the existing object
- If not defined, C++ provides a default copy constructor (shallow copy)
- Essential for deep copying when dealing with dynamic memory

**Syntax:**
```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    ClassName(const ClassName &object) {    // Copy Constructor
        // Copy data from existing object
    }
};
```

**When Copy Constructor is Called:**
- When an object is created and initialized with another object
- When an object is passed by value to a function
- When an object is returned by value from a function
- When compiler generates a temporary object

**Benefits:**
- Enables object cloning
- Essential for proper memory management with dynamic allocation
- Allows pass-by-value for objects
- Prevents shallow copy issues

### Constructor Definition Techniques:

#### 1. Constructor Inside Class (Inline)
- Constructor is defined within the class declaration
- Suitable for simple initialization logic
- Code is included directly in the class body
- Automatically inlined by the compiler

#### 2. Constructor Outside Class
- Constructor is declared inside the class and defined outside using scope resolution operator (::)
- Better for complex initialization logic
- Improves code readability and organization
- Separates interface from implementation

**Syntax:**
```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    ClassName();    // Declaration inside class
};

ClassName::ClassName() {    // Definition outside class
    // Constructor implementation
}
```

### Destructors:

A **Destructor** is a special member function that is automatically called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It has the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (~) and has no return type or parameters.

#### Key Characteristics of Destructors:
- **Same name as class with tilde (~) prefix**
- **No return type and no parameters**
- **Automatically invoked** when object is destroyed
- **Only one destructor per class** (cannot be overloaded)
- **Cannot be called explicitly** (except with delete operator)
- **Virtual destructors** are important for polymorphism

#### Purpose of Destructors:
- **Memory Deallocation**: Free dynamically allocated memory
- **Resource Cleanup**: Close files, network connections, database connections
- **Lock Release**: Release mutexes, semaphores, and other synchronization objects
- **Logging**: Record object destruction for debugging purposes
- **Cleanup Operations**: Perform any necessary cleanup before object destruction

#### Destructor Call Order:
- **Automatic Variables**: Destructors called in reverse order of construction (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
- **Dynamic Objects**: Destructors called when delete operator is used
- **Program Termination**: All remaining objects' destructors called automatically
- **Exception Handling**: Destructors called during stack unwinding

**Syntax:**
```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    ~ClassName() {          // Destructor
        // Cleanup code
    }
};
```

### Constructor and Destructor Execution Flow:

1. **Object Creation**: Constructor is called automatically
2. **Object Usage**: Object methods and data members are accessed
3. **Object Destruction**: Destructor is called automatically when:
   - Object goes out of scope
   - Program terminates
   - delete operator is used for dynamic objects
   - Exception occurs (stack unwinding)

### Memory Management with Constructors and Destructors:

#### RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):
- Resources are acquired in constructor
- Resources are released in destructor
- Ensures automatic resource management
- Prevents memory leaks and resource leaks

#### Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy:
- **Shallow Copy**: Copies pointer values (default copy constructor behavior)
- **Deep Copy**: Copies the actual data pointed to by pointers
- Custom copy constructor needed for deep copy
- Destructor must handle dynamically allocated memory properly

### Best Practices:

1. **Always Initialize Data Members**: Use constructor initialization lists when possible
2. **Handle Dynamic Memory Carefully**: Implement copy constructor and destructor for classes with pointers
3. **Use Initialization Lists**: More efficient than assignment in constructor body
4. **Make Destructors Virtual**: For base classes in inheritance hierarchies
5. **Follow Rule of Three/Five**: If you need custom destructor, copy constructor, or assignment operator, you probably need all three (or five in C++11)
6. **RAII Pattern**: Acquire resources in constructor, release in destructor
7. **Exception Safety**: Ensure constructors and destructors handle exceptions properly

### Constructor Initialization List:
A more efficient way to initialize data members, especially for const members and references.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
class ClassName {
    int value;
    const int constant;
public:
    ClassName(int v, int c) : value(v), constant(c) {
        // Constructor body
    }
};
```

**Solution**: Implement custom copy constructor for deep copying

### 2. Memory Leaks:
**Problem**: Dynamic memory not freed in destructor
**Solution**: Always implement destructor for classes with dynamic allocation

### 3. Constructor Exception Handling:
**Problem**: Exception in constructor leaves object in undefined state
**Solution**: Use RAII and proper exception handling in constructors

- **Delegating Constructors**: One constructor calling another
- **Uniform Initialization**: Consistent initialization syntax using braces
- **Default and Delete Keywords**: Explicitly control constructor generation
- **Smart Pointers**: Automatic memory management reducing need for custom destructors
